<h1>Hi, I'm Sigfus and welcome to my new Portfolio!<br/>

<h2>Status</h2> 
Hey there! I'll be updating this space regularly whenever there’s something new to share.

This portfolio is my way of documenting my learning journey and everything from study notes and progress updates to certifications I’ve earned and goals I’m working towards.

Right now, I’m focused on studying for the CompTIA A+ certification to build a solid understanding of how devices work. Though I already have a very good understanding the main focus on the study is the networking part where I want to improve on. I’m also diving my toe into Linux and Python to improve my technical skills related to it and expand my knowledge and experience.

🌠 Goals 🌠
 - CompTIA A+
 - CompTIA Networking+
 - Cisco CCNA
