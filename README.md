<h1>Hi, I'm Sigfus and welcome to my new Portfolio!<br/>

<h2>Status</h2> 
Hey there! I'll be updating this space regularly whenever there’s something new to share.

This portfolio is my way of documenting my learning journey and everything from study notes and progress updates to certifications I’ve earned and goals I’m working towards.

Right now, I’m focused on studying for the CCNA certification to build a solid understanding on networking fundementals. I’m also tipping my toe into Linux to improve my technical skills related to it and expand my knowledge and experience.



🌠 Goals 🌠
 - Cisco CCNA

<b>While CCNA is my current focus, the goal is not set in stone. I might focus on something more fitting depending on my current situation which can lead to things changing. But for now, I want to have a better Networking knowledge and CCNA provides me a great understanding on how Networking works</b>
